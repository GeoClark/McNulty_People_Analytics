#6.5.2 Data exercises
#Use the same health_insurance data set from this chapter to answer these questions.
#
#Complete the full stratified approach to modeling the three product choices that was started in 6.2. Calculate the coefficients, odds ratios and p-values in each case.
#Carefully write down your interpretation of the odds ratios from the previous question.
#Run a multinomial logistic regression model on the product outcome using Product B as reference. Calculate the coefficients, ratios and p-values in each case.
#Verify that the coefficients for Product C against reference Product B matches those calculated in 6.3.3.
#Carefully write down your interpretation of the odds ratios calculated in the previous question.
#Use the process described in 6.4.1 to simplify the multinomial model in Question 4.
